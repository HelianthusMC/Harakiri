# harakiri
A minecraft utility client designed for anarchy servers, with nice visuals and generally some novel ideas

yes, it's a seppuku fork. Stop spamming I don't care.

The reason it is a fork is because this client goes against seppuku's mission and already put in place practices.

Kind regards.

Zim tried but failed, here's his message i will not remove:


Zim is here. Zim will save this project if it's the last thing I do. 
Right after the first of this month because my boss constantly needs me to change things should've been done 2 weeks ago.

Zim-2022:
Goddamn man, congratulations on how far this project has come! I'm so sorry I was unable to properly do what I wanted to do and get this client updated to 1.16, with work and irl, Minecraft has taken a permanent back-seat for me as I continue to rebuild my life. 
Thanks for not removing me from the repo, and if you do at any point, just remember I think you're a bad ass developer and you can do anything. <3
